user: Solve 25 squared
athink: The user requests me to solve '25^2'. I know that 25^2 is equivelant to 25*25. We can go through it step by step. 25 can't be halved, but it can be multiplied by 5. So I can take the approach of doing a smaller problem and sizing it up. I know 25*4 is 100, which means 25*5 is 125. Now, all we need to do is 125*5. I know that this equals 625. I'm confident in my answer, so I'll share it.
